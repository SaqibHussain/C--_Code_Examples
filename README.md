Sample of C++ Work
========

The code contained within this repository was created as part of an assignment during my time at Cranfield University.

The code demonstrates the use of: 

- Vectors and matrices along with operations on these such as calculating norms, inverses, condition numbers, triangular forms and multiplication, 
- Overloading operators and methods
- Templates
- Comprehensive documentation using doxygen
 - Complex numbers & operations on them
